# ataxx
Introduction：
 Assimilation chess ( Ataxx ), invented by Dave Crummack and Craig Galley in 1988 and popular in TV games in 1990, 
can be said to be a derivative of black and white chess. Originally called Infection,  runs on Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari ST.  

 Rules : The game uses a 7 * 7 checkerboard.  Distinguish enemies with black and white chess pieces.  
The initial arrangement is that both sides put two pieces of chess pieces on the outer diagonal lattice.
 Players must take turns to move a piece of their own to an empty chess position, which can be one of 
the adjacent eight grids ( including diagonally adjacent grids ), or one of the adjacent eight grids separated 
by one grid. The moving new chess position will make all the enemy chesses adjacent to the eight grids become 
their own.  If the chess piece is moved to the adjacent eight grids, there will be a new chess piece appearing in 
the original chess position. Unable to play chess need to abstain. When both parties are unable to play chess, the game ends.

I haven 't implemented the PVE module yet...
